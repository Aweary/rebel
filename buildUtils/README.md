Jenga currently doesn't allow a jengaroot build rules file to load external dependencies, e.g. yojson for parsing our package.json files. Therefore, we've made two bytecode (i.e. cross-platform) executables (which use yojson under the hood, but since it's an executable this no longer matters). One of these takes in a package.json and outputs the `name` field's value to stdout. Another takes in package.json and outputs the `dependencies` JavaScript object keys, one per row. Our jengaroot can therefore call the executables and easily "parse" the output.

The package.json in this directory is only for testing. Compile extractName.re & extractDeps.re and run the executables.
